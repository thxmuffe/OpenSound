# Parvi for Windows — wxErlang

The native Windows app follows the [shared app structure](../../docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md)
used by macOS and iOS. The sidebar lists swarms and provides **New swarm** and
**Add swarm**. Selecting a swarm opens its invitation, **Graph** and **Chat** tabs.
Nodes can belong to many swarms or none; swarms own their chat histories.

**2026-10-29:** Windows launch/UI sources now also support the shared native
OTP-over-WebRTC profile used by the updated Mac/iPhone sources. Its Windows NIF
build is incomplete. The default Windows build therefore retains the working
legacy relay profile; it does not claim native-cluster interoperability.

## Windows audio input meter

The [audio-library comparison and trial](../../docs/decisions/0004-windows-audio-library-trial.md)
favours PortAudio for reusable device I/O, but its existing Erlang binding failed
the isolated Windows stream-open trial. The app retains the direct WASAPI bridge;
PortAudio is not a build or runtime dependency.

Select **Start input** above the swarm view, then play audio in an existing
player or browser using the Windows default multimedia output. Parvi displays
the captured endpoint name, a peak meter, peak/RMS levels in **dBFS**, sample
rate, channel count and captured-frame count. The meter floor is -96 dBFS;
0 dBFS is digital full scale, not a measurement of room loudness. This input is
local to the node and works independently of a swarm or desk connection.

This uses Windows' existing WASAPI loopback API to read actual PCM samples.
`parvi_windows_audio` owns the supervised `parvi_audio_input.exe` port. The thin
native bridge opens WASAPI and transfers untouched format information, PCM
buffers, flags, frame positions and capture timestamps. Erlang controls read
requests (currently about 10 ms apart), interprets Windows sample formats,
handles silent buffers, counts frames and computes levels over roughly 100 ms
windows using shared `control/src/parvi_audio_meter.erl`. No metering, sample
conversion, polling timer or background thread remains in the C++ bridge.
UI reloads do not own its capture state. **Stop input** closes the
port; input is stopped initially. The helper also exits when its owning pipe
closes. Raw samples now reach the Erlang input worker and meter; no captured
audio is saved or transmitted to other nodes. Metering/DSP starts in Erlang;
native algorithm offloading needs measured justification later.

The local bridge uses OTP's `{packet,4}` framing, with a big-endian payload
length and a one-byte message type. Type 1 contains a little-endian 32-bit
WAVEFORMAT byte count, the raw Windows format and UTF-16LE source name. Type 2
contains little-endian frame count/flags (32 bits each), device position/QPC
capture time (64 bits each), then raw interleaved PCM; silent buffers omit PCM
and Erlang supplies zeros. QPC time uses WASAPI's 100 ns units, local to this
machine, not a shared session clock; flags retain timestamp validity information.
Type 3 contains the Windows HRESULT, and type 4 ends a read batch. Erlang sends
the single byte `r` in a framed packet to request another batch. This is private
OS-bridge IPC, not a decision about network audio transport or interoperability.

This does **not** install a virtual driver or create a selectable **Parvi**
output device. Audio continues through the selected Windows output. A virtual
audio-device adapter is separate work, preferably reusing an existing driver.
If the default device changes or disconnects, stop/start input to reopen it.
Only shared Windows output is captured; protected content and exclusive-mode
applications may not be available. No frequency spectrum is implemented yet.

The normal build compiles the helper with Visual Studio and the Windows SDK;
keep it beside `Parvi.exe`. Stop input before rebuilding the native helper.
Validation: native and Erlang compilation pass with warnings as errors. Direct
checks cover float32 and PCM16/24/32 metering. An end-to-end Windows capture
check passes raw 48 kHz stereo samples through the port into the Erlang meter,
with a quiet external diagnostic tone measuring about -35 dBFS and Stop
returning the worker to stopped. Stop input before installing a rebuilt helper
and matching Erlang worker: the earlier JSON-only bridge is incompatible with
the raw-buffer protocol. No full app restart is needed for this update.
No new automated tests were added. iOS and Mac sources were not edited.

## Native source integration and remaining work

The native launcher disables EPMD, automatic transitive connections and automatic
distribution reconnect. `parvi_sup` owns the shared `pg` scope, `parvi_chat` and
desk connector. No legacy swarm gossip, topology or health worker runs in that
profile. The existing graph renders the shared snapshot without a new graph
implementation. Reception Desk traffic introduces peers; native OTP traffic
travels over the encrypted WebRTC DataChannel.

The UI uses the existing swarm labels for one native cluster per session. Start
with **New swarm**, or paste a native `parvi://cluster/v2` invitation from a
rebuilt peer. Submission is shown as pending until admission is observed.
Invitations grant whole-VM trust. **Remove both of us** confirms cluster-wide
revocation, including other logical swarms. Voluntary leave is disabled; quit
disconnects without revoking membership. Restart to switch clusters or retry a
failed join. Desk switching, mesh and automatic recovery remain unimplemented.
Legacy invitations cannot join the native profile.

Native packaging needs Windows x64 builds of the pinned `control/transport`
dependencies, Elixir runtime applications, and their native DLLs and licenses.
The first upstream Windows build compiled CRC with Visual Studio, then stopped
because Cargo was absent. Source inspection also found POSIX `sys/mman.h`,
`shm_open` and socket/time headers in Shmex/Unifex/DTLS; installing Rust alone
does not establish a usable Windows build. No dependency sources were patched.
The next increment is a Windows-supported build/port of those NIF dependencies,
then a native app build and an invitation/chat check through the global desk.
Shared/Windows Erlang and the Win32 launcher compile, and a Windows OTP VM boots
the carrier without EPMD. The legacy app was rebuilt; native app startup, NIF
packaging and connectivity remain unverified. See [progress](../../docs/PROGRESS.md).

For an externally prepared, self-contained Windows dependency bundle only:

```powershell
.\Apps\Windows\build.ps1 -Transport Native -NativeLibRoot C:\path\to\windows-native-lib
```

The supplied directory must contain one application directory per dependency,
including `parvi_transport`, `elixir`, `eex` and `logger`, with `ebin/`, `priv/`
and license files. All dependent DLLs must be included in their Windows runtime
locations; Mac shared objects and iPhone static archives cannot be reused.
The builder checks application startup and actual DTLS/SRTP/SCTP/CRC NIF loading
before updating the bundle, copies the supplied libraries into `native_lib/`,
and records the launch profile in `runtime-profile`. This input hook has not
been exercised with a complete Windows native bundle. There is no automatic
fallback from failed native packaging to relay mode.

## Build and launch

Requires Windows x64, PowerShell, and Visual Studio's **Desktop development with
C++** workload. From the repository root:

```powershell
.\Apps\Windows\setup.ps1
.\Apps\Windows\build.ps1 -Transport Legacy
.\builds\Windows\Parvi\Parvi.exe
```

Setup verifies and extracts the official OTP 29.1.2 archive into
`builds/intermediates/Windows/otp`. To reuse an older ignored runtime cache, set
`PARVI_OTP_ROOT` to that extracted directory before building. No global Erlang
installation or PATH change is required. Keep `Parvi.exe`, `ebin/`, and `runtime/`
together. The current build is unsigned and retains the full runtime libraries.
Keep the generated `runtime-profile` file with the executable. Native builds
also require `native_lib/`. Both launchers read the same profile file.
Use `.\Apps\Windows\run.ps1` for terminal diagnostics.

After upgrading from the old node-sidebar UI, launch the executable at the new
path above. Backend/model changes require restarting older sessions once.

## Legacy profile: join through a Reception desk

Restart the rebuilt Windows app: it automatically connects to
`wss://parvi-reception-desk.onrender.com/relay/v1`, configured once in the shared
OTP settings at `control/src/parvi.app.src`. Copy a selected swarm invitation to
the other app's Add swarm field. No manual URL entry or port forwarding is needed.
Public WSS invitations and chat have been verified; the updated physical-iPhone
build still needs verification.

For a local desk, run `.\Services\ReceptionDesk\run.ps1` and set
`PARVI_RECEPTION_DESK_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765/relay/v1` before startup, or change
**Reception desk URL** and select **Use desk (new session)** in the UI. This
discards the current transient memberships and creates a fresh relay session.
Relay mode displays connection observations, and does
not draw fictional direct peer links. See the [protocol](../../docs/RELAY_PROTOCOL.md).
The full browser client is not required.

## Legacy profile: join and select swarms (local development mode)

Set `$env:PARVI_RECEPTION_DESK_URL = ""` before launching from PowerShell to
select local-only transport instead of the public default. Launch two instances.
In the first, select a swarm and copy **Invitation to this
swarm** using Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C or the native context menu. In the second, paste into
**Add a swarm** and click **Add swarm**. Only one admission is needed. Both nodes
can then chat in that swarm. Their other memberships remain independent.

**New swarm** creates and selects another swarm. Clicking a sidebar row makes it
current without changing any memberships. **Leave swarm** ends only that
membership. Leaving every swarm keeps the node running and shows the empty-state
instructions. The prototype starts with one fresh swarm for convenience.

The Chat composer and history belong to the selected swarm. Drafts survive
selection changes and window rebuilds; acknowledgments clear only the matching
submitted draft. Histories remain in `parvi_swarms`, bounded to 200 messages per
swarm for this session. New members do not receive earlier history.

Invitations use `parvi://swarm/v1?node=...&cookie=...&swarm=...&token=...`.
These legacy local invitations include private Erlang credentials and work only
between trusted Parvi nodes on the same computer. Relay mode instead generates
v2 invitations containing desk/node/mailbox credentials without Erlang cookies. The shared core handles admission, leave and mutual
removal. These strings are different from the legacy node connection strings.
The Reception Desk directory remains a separate service; joining a swarm uses
its member invitation directly.

## Legacy profile: graph and node details

Graph shows only the selected swarm's members and observed distribution links
between them. It uses the attributed native OTP Reltool force graph with the
bundled layout engine; see [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY.md). Drag nodes to
arrange them. The hidden graph pauses while Chat is selected.

Click a graph vertex or member-list row to see the node identity. For another
member, **Remove both of us** asks for confirmation and invokes the same
swarm-scoped operation as the Apple apps. Other memberships stay intact.

Status lights retain RabbitMQ Management's existing palette, with text labels:
Running (green), Not responding (yellow), Disconnected (red), Checking (grey).
The shared `parvi_network` worker observes OTP connection events and probes the
swarm worker asynchronously. Disconnected does not prove that a VM stopped.
The local node shows Running even while the Reception desk is reconnecting;
desk connectivity is shown separately in the sidebar.
The temporary disconnected-action error clears when a subsequent snapshot
confirms the desk connection. Failed sends retain their draft and are not retried
automatically.
A member can remain in the roster while disconnected. Observations are sampled,
not a globally consistent topology or an audio routing graph.

## Automatic code reload

Compiling `Apps/Windows/src/parvi_windows.erl` into the running app's `ebin/`
rebuilds its window automatically, normally within a second. Building skips an
unchanged native launcher, so UI-only builds work while the app is open.
Selection, drafts by swarm, selected tab, invitation input and geometry belong to
the supervised model; they survive disposal of the window. Pending actions also
belong to the model, so they complete while a window is being replaced.

There is no rollback. Incomplete BEAM output is ignored; valid code that fails to
start leaves the UI unavailable until a corrected build arrives. Ordinary window
crashes use normal OTP supervision.

The same 750 ms loop also reloads every changed, already-loaded project module
in the app's `ebin/`, including the backend, model and reloader itself. It uses
OTP's `code:module_status/1`, purges old code and loads the replacement. This is
always enabled, with no development/testing mode, compatibility checks, state
migration or rollback. Existing process state is kept; incompatible changes can
crash processes, and purging can kill processes still executing old code. Load
failures are logged and retried on the next poll. Newly referenced modules load
normally through OTP. Native libraries, runtime and launch settings still need
their own upgrade/restart. Restart an app running the earlier UI-only reloader
once to install this behavior; subsequent compiled backend changes reload too.

## Checks

```powershell
.\Apps\Windows\build.ps1 -Transport Legacy -Test
python .\Apps\Windows\reload-smoke.py
```

EUnit covers the shared chat/swarm core and Windows model: graph membership
filtering, isolated histories/drafts, delayed acknowledgments, rejected invitations,
and a live node with no swarms. The isolated native-window test checks real peer
membership, scoped graphs, repeated reloads, model/worker continuity, failed-build
recovery without rollback, window-crash recovery and an in-flight swarm send.
It uses private module copies and temporary local nodes.

The legacy transport/directory smoke test remains available via
`python Apps/Windows/smoke.py` after compiling ReceptionDesk with its Windows
launcher (`run-legacy.ps1`). It tests the old bridge compatibility path, not the swarm UI.
These existing helpers do not validate native Windows startup, admission or
WebRTC interoperability. No tests were added or run for the native source update.

## Current scope and runtime provenance

This is native wxErlang in the local BEAM with shared `control/` code. Windows-Mac and Windows-iPhone relay interoperability still requires rebuilt
Apple apps and physical-device testing. There is no audio
engine yet. UI snapshots refresh roughly every 600 ms; this is not an audio
latency claim. Quitting ends the node and all transient memberships.

The official Windows OTP archive is pinned to 29.1.2 with SHA-256
`4efe9772a84c6c1ef75377e9326815584958776c905f2bf687b62509e2d809c0`.
Erlang/OTP is Apache-2.0 licensed; wxWidgets uses the wxWindows Library Licence.
Keep the bundled notices with the runtime when distributing it.
